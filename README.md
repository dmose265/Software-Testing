# Software-Testing project
The program implements input generators for ;
1. Boundary value analysis
2. Robustness Testing
3. Worst-case Testing
4. Worst-case Robustness Testing

The generator prompts the user to  input:
1. To select one of the 4 options given.
2. User selects the number of  variables.
3. The user inputs the range of the variables .


TRIANGLE AND NEXTDATE FUNCTION

TRIANGLE PROBLEM

Simple Version:
This triangle program accepts 3 integers , a , b & C as the input. The inputs are
taken as the sides of the triangle.  The output of the program is the type of triangle
that is determined by the 3 sides. The possible output is Equilateral, Isoscles,
Scalene, or NotAtriangle.

Improved Versions (2 and 3)
This versions takes in 3 integers a, b and c as input The inputs are taken as the sides
of the triangle. The integers mus satisfy some conditions before being determined
what type fo triangle it is. If the input value fails any conditions c1, c2 or c3, 
the program notifies the user with a message.


NEXTDATE FUNCTION (Simple & Improved Version)
The NextDate involves a Function  of 3 variables i.e month , day, year. The program returns 
tomorrows date in the form of mm/dd/yyyy. The variables must be integer values.
The simple and improved version illustrates logical complexities among input variables.
